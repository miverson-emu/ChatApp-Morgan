# COSC481W-Group4
There are 3 branches auth (login/signup authentication), prof (profile management), and chat (messaging/conversations). There are also three folders of the same name. 

The only things in each folder is App.js, components, screens, navigation and a .txt file with what modules are needed. 
Please only edit the folders in their respective branch. 

Also, there is a .txt file called setup in the Resources folder on how to set up the react native app environment and how to install modules through nodeJS npm. 

Let me know if y’all need any more GUI/screens or components. 

Per our first presentation these are the assignments and aims. 

Chat - 1-1 messages and group messaging 
(Guys - Ben, Yhayh, Jacob)

Login/SignUp - Research
 (Yaneli)

Profile - View/Edit
 (Morgan)

GUI - Screens and Nav 
(Morgan)


I think we have enough to get started pretty good. Let me know if y’all need any help or explanations.
